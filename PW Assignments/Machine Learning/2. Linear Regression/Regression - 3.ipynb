    "**QI. What is Ridge Regression, and how does it differ from ordinary least squares regression?**\n",
    "- Ridge regression is a regularized linear regression model that shrinks the coefficients towards zero, reducing overfitting and improving predictive performance.\n",
    "- Differs from ordinary least squares regression by adding a penalty term to the loss function\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2. What are the assumptions of Ridge Regression?**\n",
    "   - Linearity: The relationship between the dependent and independent variables should be linear.\n",
    "   - Homoscedasticity: The variance of the residuals should be constant.\n",
    "   - Normality: The residuals should be normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3. How do you select the value of the tuning parameter (lambda) in Ridge Regression?**\n",
    "- To select the value of the tuning parameter (lambda) in ridge regression, you can use a cross-validation technique such as k-fold cross-validation or leave-one-out cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4. Can Ridge Regression be used for feature selection? If yes, how?**\n",
    "- Yes, ridge regression can be used for feature selection by shrinking the coefficients of irrelevant features towards zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q5. How does the Ridge Regression model perform in the presence of multicollinearity?**\n",
    "- Ridge regression performs well in the presence of multicollinearity because it shrinks the coefficients of correlated features, reducing the impact of multicollinearity on the model's predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q6. Can Ridge Regression handle both categorical and continuous independent variables?**\n",
    "- Yes, ridge regression can handle both categorical and continuous independent variables. Categorical variables can be converted to dummy variables before fitting the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q7. How do you interpret the coefficients of Ridge Regression?**\n",
    "- The coefficients of ridge regression can be interpreted similarly to the coefficients of ordinary least squares regression, but they should be interpreted with caution as they are biased.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q8. Can Ridge Regression be used for time-series data analysis? If yes, how?**\n",
    "- Yes, ridge regression can be used for time-series data analysis by modeling the dependent variable as a function of the lagged independent variables."
