    "**QI. What is Elastic Net Regression and how does it differ from other regression techniques?**\n",
    "- Elastic Net Regression is a regularized linear regression model that combines the L1 and L2 penalties. It differs from other regression techniques by being able to both shrink coefficients and perform feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2. How do you choose the optimal values of the regularization parameters for Elastic Net Regression?**\n",
    "- The optimal values of the regularization parameters for Elastic Net Regression can be chosen using cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Elastic Net Regression?**\n",
    "   - It can reduce overfitting.\n",
    "   - It can select important features.\n",
    "   - It is robust to multicollinearity.\n",
    "   - It is computationally efficient.\n",
    "   \n",
    "**Q4. What are some common use cases for Elastic Net Regression?**\n",
    "   - Predicting continuous variables (e.g., house prices, customer churn)\n",
    "   - Classifying data (e.g., email spam or not spam)\n",
    "   - Feature selection (e.g., identifying the most important genes associated with a disease)\n",
    "   \n",
    "**Q5. How do you interpret the coefficients in Elastic Net Regression?**\n",
    "- The coefficients in Elastic Net Regression can be interpreted similarly to the coefficients in other regression models, but they should be interpreted with caution as they are biased.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q6. How do you handle missing values when using Elastic Net Regression?**\n",
    "- Missing values in Elastic Net Regression can be handled using imputation techniques such as mean imputation or median imputation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q7. How do you use Elastic Net Regression for feature selection?**\n",
    "- Elastic Net Regression can be used for feature selection by shrinking the coefficients of irrelevant features to zero."
